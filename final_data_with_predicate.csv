risk management plan,"the risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed. the risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements: risk strategy. describes the general approach to managing risk on this project. methodology. deﬁnes the speciﬁc approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk management on the project. roles and responsibilities. deﬁnes the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of activity described in the risk management plan, and clariﬁes their responsibilities. funding. identiﬁes the funds needed to perform activities related to project risk management. establishes protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves. timing. deﬁnes when and how often the project risk management processes will be performed throughout the project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule. risk categories. provide a means for grouping individual project risks. a common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure (rbs), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see example in figure 11-4). an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks. the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects, or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored rbs. where an rbs is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives. rbs level 00. all sources ofproject risk1. technical risk2. management risk3. commercial risk4. external riskrbs level 1rbs

11-4. extract from sample risk breakdown structure (rbs) stakeholder risk appetite. the risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the plan risk management process. in particular, stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks. definitions of risk probability and impacts. deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. the project may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided by the organization. the number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple process (usually three). table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact deﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities (reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).table 11-1. example of definitions for

advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to the speciﬁc project. opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using positive deﬁnitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact deﬁnitions for threats. descriptive terms (such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. an example probability and impact matrix is presented in figure 11-5, which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme.figure 11-5. example probability and

model several thousand times. the input values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random for each iteration. outputs represent the range

usually expressed as a percentage. the output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the project. sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. it correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation coefﬁcient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome. this can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources of ambiguity. items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.  an example tornado diagram is shown in figure 11-14.figure 11-14. example tornado diagramactivity or risk drivingprojection durationcorrelation with project duration-0.2          -0.1          0             0.1

decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both threats and opportunities). the end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path, which can be negative or positive.the decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal path to be selected. an example decision tree is shown in figure 11-15.figure 11-15. example decision treecomputed: payoffs minus costs along pathdecision definitiondecision nodechance nodenet

how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as “decision nodes”)when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as “chance nodes”).note 2: here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120m us to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50m usto upgrade the existing plant. for each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a“chance node”) must be accounted for. for example, strong demand leads to $200m revenue with the new plantbut only $120m us for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. the end of each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. for each decision branch, all effects are added (seeshaded areas) to determine the overall expected monetary value (emv) of the decision. remember to account forthe investment costs. from the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher emv of $46m – also the emv of the overall decision. (this choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible outcome of a loss of $30m).decision nodechance nodeend of branchstrong demand($200m)weak demand($90m)strong demand($120m)weak demand($60m)build new plant(invest $120m)upgrade plant(invest $50m)  influence diagrams. inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. an inﬂuence diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and inﬂuences, together with the relationships and effects between them. where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the inﬂuence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. the inﬂuence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as monte carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest inﬂuence on key outcomes. outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, including s-curves and tornado diagrams.","captures/page_40_image_1.png ,

strategies for threats,"five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows: escalate. escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. escalated risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the project level. the project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. it is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat occurred. escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information. avoid. risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact. it may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact. avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. the risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur. examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise. transfer. transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for speciﬁed risks to another party. mitigate. in risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. mitigation may involve prototype development (see section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. for example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. accept. risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. this strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.

strategies for opportunities,"five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows: escalate. this risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the project level. the project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. it is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information. exploit. the exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration. share. sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. it is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures. enhance. the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the beneﬁt after the opportunity has occurred. the probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. where it is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential beneﬁt. examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to ﬁnish early. accept. accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. this strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.", ,"Escalate is a risk response strategy used when an opportunity does not fit into the project's scope.

contingent response strategies,"some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. for some risks, it is appropriate for the project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predeﬁned conditions, if it is believed that there will be sufﬁcient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller, should be deﬁned and tracked. risk responses identiﬁed using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identiﬁed triggering events that set the plans in effect.", ,"A risk response is a set of actions that are designed to manage a particular risk.

strategies for overall project risk,"risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall project risk. the same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk: avoid. where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. this involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. an example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be canceled. this represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable. exploit. where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. this involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. an example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition of high-beneﬁt elements of scope to the project to add value or beneﬁts to stakeholders. alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modiﬁed with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity. transfer/share. if the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively, a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. in the case of high positive overall project risk, ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated beneﬁts. examples of both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project.  mitigate/enhance. these strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving the project’s objectives. the mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive. examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project, changing the scope and boundaries of the project, modifying project priority, changing resource allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc. accept. where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently deﬁned, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly.", ,"In order to better understand how risk is best managed, the UM uses the example of a project that has a very high overall risk.
